This test aims to generate many folders and files with random size and  contents. 

These files will then be downloaded using wget --mirror, to stress test a HTTP file server. 

Furthermore, the downloaded files and folders will be compared with the originals, in order to check if the HTTP file server has done a decent job of serving files.
